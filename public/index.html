            The boundry between what I want to do professionally and what I want to do for play gets blurry from time to time. <br />
            I see professionals like Jimmy Chin, Chris Burkard, and Paul Nicklen traveling all over the world, doing the things I dream of and go, "I can probably actually do that." Find the raddest places on earth, put together a trip, and go explore and take pictures. Then I think about how much I love deloping applications and making pretty things on a computer screen. I love to code, I love to build and I love to make something that comes to life and see real people actually use it. It's something that, as a developer, you don't usually get to see that whole range of experience, but as I build my new applications, it's something I'm really excited for. <br /><br />
            I love Silicon Valley. I love that there's always someone around building something cooler and newer to push what is possible in technology. All around this place people are actively looking for problems they can fix and build solutions for. I learned about a position at Facebook the other week called a Solutions Engineer. These people literally go to companies, find out what problems they have and figure out how to fix them. We live in a culture where everything can be better. Everything can be improved, and everything has a good reason to be improved. <br />
            More ranting to come, but I just wanted to share my excitement about the cross between play and work. <br /><br />

            A year and a half ago, I wrote about getting a job in Silicon Valley. Coming from being a student, going through interviews and perfecting my coding skills, I was despretly looking to be hired somewhere. I wanted a job and experience of what it was like to code in the real world. I made a blog detailing that process, but it went on a website that I took down and since have lost the source code for. Now I've spent some time as a front-end developer and learned a couple things that I can talk about.
